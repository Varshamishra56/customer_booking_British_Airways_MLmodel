# Predictive Modeling of Customer Bookings

This repository contains the code and results for a predictive model developed to forecast customer bookings. The project aims to utilize machine learning techniques to predict whether a customer will book a holiday based on various features in the provided dataset.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to build and evaluate predictive models to determine the likelihood of customers booking holidays. The analysis includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and interpretation of feature importance.

## Data Preprocessing

The dataset underwent several preprocessing steps:
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Normalizing numerical features
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets

## Model Training

Two machine learning algorithms were used for this project:
1. RandomForest
2. Logistic Regression

The models were trained and their performance was evaluated using confusion matrices, ROC curves, and precision-recall analysis.

## Results Interpretation

The analysis demonstrated that the RandomForest model performed better in predicting customer bookings. The feature importance analysis revealed that variables such as flight duration, length of stay, and purchase lead time significantly contribute to the model's predictive power.

## Conclusion

This project successfully developed and evaluated a predictive model for customer bookings. Future work could involve exploring other machine learning algorithms, tuning hyperparameters, and incorporating additional features for improved performance.
